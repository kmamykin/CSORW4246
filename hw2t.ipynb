    "Will use a modified Djikstra algorithm (v3 with min-priority queue) to find shortest paths from root $s$ to all other nodes in the graph. In each Update(u, v) procedure we will keep track of the $best[v]$ (array to represent the number of edges in the shortest path).\n",

This also orders elements in Q to have s as the node with min key/priority = 0 and all other nodes with key/priority = Inf. prev is initialized to NIL as there are no shortest paths found yet. best initialized to infinity. S (calculated) is an empty set (nothing processed yet).\n",

    "Maintenance: inside the loop, u is extracted from Q. This removes the node u from Q and implicitly updates S. The invariants for Q and S are maintained. dist, prev invariants are part of the proof for Djikstra algorith and assumed to be maintained. We just need to proof the maintenance of best[] array for each iteration. When node u is extracted from Q, it is a node on the shortest path from $s$ through some node $x \\in S$. When Update(u, v) is called for all edges from u to v, there may be 3 cases: 1) distance to v through u is larger then previously estimated distance to v through some previously processed node. In this case we dont need to do anything to maintain invariant, best[v] already contains the min number of edges in the shortest path. 2) distance to v though u is smaller then previously estimated. This means (s, ..., u, v) is the shortest path to v. Update best[v] = best[u] + 1, prev[v] = u. 3) distance to v through u is the same as through some previously processed node and both are the shortest paths (the other node in S which caused dist[v] to be updated is on the shortest path proven by Djikstra algo). Here we check which path has fewer edges and update best[v] = min(best[v], best[u]+1), prev[v] = (best[u] + 1 < best[v]) ? u : prev[v]. This maintains the invariant on array best.\n",

When $k > 0$, we have more then 1 partition, and multiple choices of the last partition index $j_k$. For each choice of $j_k$ we calculate the imbalance of this partition as a max of optimal partition up to index $j_k$ and imbalance value from $j_k + 1$ to $l$ ($I_{j_k+1, l}$). Overall the optimal partition choice will be the min of all partition choices for this $k$ and $l$.\n",

Then proceed to the next row, as each row only depends on previous row. Important to note that bacause we need at least $k+1$ elements to split into $k$ partitions, we do not need to compute elements $k \\ge l$, so the elements on and below the diagonal from top left corner of the matrix will be empty. Similarly, the first partition can not start after $n-k$ element as there needs to be space to place the rest of the partirion indices. Therefor we don't need to compute solutions where $l > row + (n-k)$, which is above the diagonal from the bottom right. We only need to fill out solutions in a parallelogram shape, $n-k$ width and $k$ height (important for the tight runtime bound). The final optimal imbalance $OPT(k, n)$ and will be found as the bottom right element of the solution matrix.\n",
