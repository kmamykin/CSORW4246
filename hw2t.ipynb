S (calculated) is an empty set (nothing processed yet).\n",

    "Maintenance: inside the loop, u is extracted from Q. This removes the node u from Q and implicitly updates S. The invariants for Q and S are maintained. dist, prev invariants are part of the proof for Djikstra algorith and assumed to be maintained. We just need to proof the maintenance of best[] array for each iteration. When node u is extracted from Q, it is a node on the shortest path from $s$ through some node $x \\in S$. When Update(u, v) is called for all edges from u to v, there may be 3 cases: 1) distance to v through u is larger then previously estimated distance to v through some previously processed node. In this case we dont need to do anything to maintain invariant, best[v] already contains the min number of edges in the shortest path. 2) distance to v though u is smaller then previously estimated. This means (s, ..., u, v) is the shortest path to v. Update best[v] = best[u] + 1, prev[v] = u. 3) distance to v through u is the same as through some previously processed node and both are the shortest paths (the other node in S which caused dist[v] to be updated is on the shortest path proven by Djikstra algo). Here we check which path has fewer edges and update best[v] = min(best[v], best[u]+1), prev[v] = (best[u] + 1 < best[v]) ? u : prev[v]. This maintains the invariant on array best.\n",
