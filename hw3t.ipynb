Since augmenting path has a positive non-zero capacity on each iteration the graph flow will increase. When solving a min-cost problem we could compute resudual graph for the costs, and pick an augmenting path that reduces the cost of flow, and augment the flow. Then at some point we will reach a min-cost flow.\n",
